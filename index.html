        Git is a distributed version control system that has become the de facto
        standard for software development teams around the world.<br />It allows
        multiple developers to collaborate on a codebase, track changes, and
        revert to previous versions if needed.<br />Git is flexible and can be
        used for projects of any size, from small personal projects to large,
        complex software applications.<br />It is also highly customizable and
        has a vast ecosystem of tools and plugins available to help streamline
        development workflows. With Git, developers can work more efficiently
        and effectively, ensuring that their projects are always in a state of
        continuous improvement.
